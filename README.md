# StellarNews
StellarNews is an iOS app that helps you to stay informed about the transient high-energy sky using different active sources around the world. 

This project is solving the Transient Watch â€“ Daily News on Active Neutron Stars and Black Holes on Your Mobile Phone challenge.

#Description
The main goal of this work was to develop an informative mobile application about the daily news of the recent discovered transient lights in Space. To achieve this were collected and grouped an amount of data from different observatories and agencies engaged into the exploration and analysis of transient data.

This data once obtained was processed as a json file by a web server to be consulted in a better way. From time to time this data is periodically and automatically updated.

Subsequently a notification system is created to keep the user of the mobile device informed on new discoveries and events. These notifications are sent when a change in the data is detected.

For every space event the app shows several sources of data. Among the databases used we have: SIMBAD, MAXI, SWIFT, CATALINA (Caltech) and FERMI.

The front-end is simple and friendly. Also the option to share these discoveries to social networks and emails are available.
